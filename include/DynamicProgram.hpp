/*! @class DynamicProgram
 *  @brief Dynamic Program to calculate the best holistic detection
 *
 *  The Dynamic Program calculates the best holistic detection given a
 *  set of part detections and a model of the parts' likely relationships
 *  with their parents. The class has two primary methods: min() and argmin().
 *
 *  min() computes the best candidates by passing messages from the leaves
 *  of the Part tree to the root. argmin() traverses back down the tree to
 *  retrieve the actual Part locations
